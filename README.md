# Hello there

I'm a front-end developer, graphic designer and a organisor based in Brussels.
My stack includes: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, Vue and Nuxt. I'm currently focussing on Javascript and want to get into Typescript and animations soon.

I'm doing a traineeship at Becode until November '21.
Some try-out projects i've worked on the past months while at BeCode:
