# Currently learning at BeCode

#### **my objectives as a coder / what i want to achieve during BeCode**
- [ ] get proficient at developing projects with a team so i can work on professional projects after
- [ ] getting the (power) tools to build the weird things/sites/tools i dream up sometimes
- [ ] creative coding
- [ ] being able to set up effective sites to help out friends / initiatives I want to support

#### **tiny fears**
- that i'll get depressed sitting behind my computer that much (especially if corona restrictions are *f-i-n-a-l-ly* abolished)
- I'm not very good at math, so I worry about getting my head around certain concepts

#### **things i value in team work**
