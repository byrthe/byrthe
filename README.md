# Hello there

I'm a front-end developer, graphic designer and a organisor based in Brussels.
My stack includes: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, Vue and Nuxt. I'm currently focussing on Javascript and want to get into Typescript and animations soon.

## Immo price estimator 
For the challenge we were asked to interact with GET and POST to an API that was created by a student from the AI class. The API calculates the estimation based on scraped Immo-web data. I used Tailwind to create a basic styling. A project in collaboration with Atefeh Hossein who developed the API.

## Skillbank
For this project we were asked to explore relational database architecture using SQLite3 and node.js. I made a basic prototype for a skill sharing website. The site is currently not deployed nor responsive, but if i'm working towards that.
